#  Self-contained macOS/Linux launcher for the EverLua bridge.
#  Double-clickable in Finder (that is why it is a .command, not a .sh: a .sh
#  opens in an editor instead of running). It has NO dependency on start.py -
#  it finds Python, ensures the one required library is installed, frees a
#  previous bridge still holding the port, then runs bridge.py itself.
#  The Windows equivalent is start.bat.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
